        <p>Hello! This is a platform that helps small businesses advertise their products 
        and share their story on the process of building their small business. Small 
        businesses can add a link to their websites and upload images of their products. </p>
        <p>
            This is a blog that is solely for publicity for these smaller businesses that 
            may find it hard to reach their targeted audiences. It is also a chance for 
            customers wanting to purchase from small businesses, find a store to purchase 
            from easily and efficiently. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Have fun scrolling through the different businesses!
        </p>
